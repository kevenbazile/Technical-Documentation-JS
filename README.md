# Technical-Documentation-JS


In this project I demonstrate how to construct a website like this with ai and freecode camp to inprove development ability
this took me an hour to make not because i did not know because i wanted to see the most efficent way to make this and digest for future projects.

My methos of approach was to ensure ai knew the task; after feeding it the assignment i was then able to complete the assignments in sequential order. 
Along the process I remebered you can view page source and see html, it was in one of the course lessons so i sped the process of writing code down
by copying that hrml and snipping a screen shot of the page so claude could generate my css code as well

Great for research just to see the efficiency of a developer who has all tools at his finger tips
